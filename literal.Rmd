# Literal Characters {#literal}

We're going to start with the simplest match of all: a __literal character__.
A literal character match is one in which a given character such as the letter
`"R"` matches the letter _R_. This type of match is the most basic 
type of regular expression operation: just matching plain text.


## Matching Literal Characters

The following examples are extremely basic but they will help you get a 
good understanding of regex.

Consider the following text stored in a character vector `this_book`:

```{r book}
this_book <- 'This book is mine'
```

The first regular expression we are going to work with is `"book"`. 
This pattern is formed by a letter _b_, followed by a letter _o_, followed by 
another letter _o_, followed by a letter _k_. As you may guess, this pattern 
matches the word _book_ in the character vector `this_book`. 
To have a visual representation of the actual pattern that is matched, you
should use the function `str_view()` from the package `"stringr"` 
(you may need to upgrade to a recent version of RStudio):

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view(this_book, 'book')
```

As you can tell, the pattern `"book"` doesn't match the entire content in
the vector `this_book`; it just matches those four letters.

It may seem really simple but there are a couple of details to be highlighted.
The first is that regex searches are case sensitive by default. This means 
that the pattern `"Book"` would not match _book_ in ``this_book``.

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view("This Book is mine.", 'book')
```

You can change the matching task so that it is case insensitive but we will
talk about it later.

Let's add more text to `this_book`:

```{r book_online}
this_book <- 'This book is mine. I wrote this book with bookdown.'
```

Let's use `str_view()` to see what pieces of text are matched in `this_book` 
with the pattern `"book"`:

```{r grep_book, eval = FALSE}
str_view(this_book, "book")
```

As you can tell, only the first occurrence of _book_ was matched. This is
a common behavior of regular expressions in which they return a match as fast
possible. You can think of this behavior as the "eager principle", that is,
regular expressions are eager and they will give preference to an early match.
This is a minor but important detail and we will come back to this behavior of 
regular expressions.

All the letters and digits in the English alphabet are considered literal 
characters. They are called _literal_ because they match themselves.

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view("I had 3 quesadillas for lunch", "3")
```

Here is another example:

```{r}
transport <- c("car", "bike", "boat", "airplane")
```

The first pattern to test is the letter `"a"`:

```{r eval = FALSE}
str_view(transport, "a")
```

When you execute the previous command, you should be able to see that the 
letter `"a"` is highlighted in the words _car_, _boat_ and _airplane_.
