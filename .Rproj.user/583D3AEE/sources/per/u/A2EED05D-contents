This book aims to provide a panoramic perspective of the wide array of 
string manipulations that you can perform with R. If you are new to R, or 
lack experience working with character data, this book will help you get 
started with the basics of handling strings. Likewise, if you are already
familiar with R, you will find material that shows you how to do more 
advanced string and text processing operations.

Despite the fact that R may not be as rich and diverse as other scripting 
languages when it comes to string manipulation, it can take you very far if 
you know how. Sadly, documentation on how to manipulate strings and text data 
in R is very scarce. This work is my two cents to increase the number of 
available resources about this indispensable topic for any data scientist.




## About this book


This book is NOT about textual data analysis, linguistic analysis, text mining, 
or natural language processing (NLP). 
However, even if you don't plan to do text analysis, text mining, or natural 
language processing, I bet you have some dataset that contains data as 
characters: names of rows, names of columns, dates, monetary quantities, 
longitude and latitude, etc. I'm sure that you have encountered one or more of 
the following cases:



Hopefully after reading this book, you will have the necessary tools in your 
toolbox for dealing with these (and many) other situations that involve 
handling and processing strings in R.


### Structure of the book

The content of the book is divided in five major parts:

1. Getting started with character strings
2. Formatting and printing text and numbers
3. Input and output
4. Basic string manipulations
5. Working with Regular Expressions

If you have minimal or none experience with R, the best place to start is 
[Chapter 2: Characters](#chars). If you are already familiar with the basics
of vectors and character objects, you can quickly skim this chapter, or skip it, 
and then go to another chapter of your interest.

Chapter 2 describes different ways to format text and numbers. These are 
useful tools for when you want to produce output that will either be displayed
on screen, or that will be exported to a file.

The third major component of the book has to do with reading in information from
text files, as well as exporting output to text to files.

The fourth part of the book deals with _basic_ string manipulations. By "basic"
I mean any type of manipulation and transformation that does not require
the use of regular expressions.

The fifth part comprises working with regular expressions. Here you will learn
about the basic concepts around regular expressions (regex), the intricacies 
when working with regex in R, and becoming familiar with the regex functions 
in the R package __stringr__.

Last but not least, the last chapters of the book present a couple of case 
studies and extended practical examples that cover the main topics covered
in the book.


### Main Resources

Documentation on how to manipulate strings and text data in R is very scarce. 
This is mostly because R is not perceived as a scripting language (like Python 
or Java, among others). However, I seriously think that we need to have more 
available resources about this indispensable topic. 

There is not much documentation on how to manipulate character strings and text 
data in R. There are great R books for an enormous variety of statistical 
methods, graphics and data visualization, as well as applications in a wide 
range of fields such as ecology, genetics, psychology, finance, economics, etc. 
But not for manipulating strings and text data. 

Perhaps the main reason for this lack of resources is that R is not considered 
to be qualified as a "scripting" language: R is primarily perceived as a 
language for computing and programming with (mostly numeric) data. Quoting

### Acknowledgements

This book is a major iteration on a previous ebook that I wrote in 2013:
_Handling and Processing Strings in R_. As you can tell, I've shorten the
title to just __Handling Strings with R__. I've also expanded the content to
include many more examples, code snippets, and material about regular 
expressions.

As always, many thanks to Jessica who patiently accepted my occupying of the
dinning table as my workbench (~~that's over now~~).

## Exercises

1. Why do we say that `print()` is not really one function but a _family_ of functions?

2. Mention three differences between `print()` and `cat()`.

3. What happens when you pass a matrix to `cat()`? For instance:

```{r cat_matrix, eval = FALSE}
m <- matrix(1:12, nrow = 3, ncol = 4)
cat(m)
```

4. What happens when you pass a data frame object to `cat()`? For instance:

```{r cat_dataframe, eval = FALSE}
dfr <- data.frame(a = 1, b = 2, c = 3)
cat(dfr)
```
